    # Non-notebook Workflow Setup

    The non-notebook workflow allows you to complete all lab assignments on your own computer, without jupyter notebooks.

    In order to properly use the non-notebook workflow, we have written instructions to be able to set up your local computer to run the labs.  Carefully read and follow each instruction.  You will be using Anaconda, a popular tool used for python and data science, and Microsoft 

    ### Step 1. Go to this link and download the anaconda version that corresponds to your operating system.  Make sure you download Anaconda for Python 3.6.
    
    ### Step 2. Once Anaconda is downloaded, follow the setup instructions to install Anaconda.  Anaconda is a popular tool used for python and data science.
    
    ### Step 3. Open Anaconda Navigator, select "Environments" on the left side bar, and select the triangle button next to "base (root)" like in the picture below
    
    ### Step 4. A small dropdown menu should appear.  In that dropdown menu, select "Open Terminal".  This should launch the Terminal application.
    
    ### Step 5. Inside Terminal, input the following command into the application and press "Enter"

    ```conda install pip```

    Then do the same thing with this command.

    ```pip install datascience```

    And this command too.

    ```pip install okpy```

    After you have successfully run all 3 commands, you can close Terminal.

    ### Step 6. Now go back to Anaconda Navigator and select "Home" on the left navigation bar.  Look for the "vscode" application, this is the Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  If "vscode" is not yet installed, select "install". 

    You should now be ready to use the non-notebook workflow to complete labs in Data 8X!

    # Downloading Labs

    Each week, you will need to download the lab files for the non-notebook workflow.

    Follow the instructions below to download labs each week.

    Open Anaconda Navigator after you have completed all the instructions for setting up the non-notebook workflow.  Once "vscode" is installed, select "launch" to open Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

    ### Step 1. Go [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fh3pwH0SzGabkCqyfnbZJ4Qpub7xB6r?usp=sharing) to download the raw lab notebook files.  Select the file for the week's lab and download the zip file for the lab.  Unzip the lab zip file and move it to somewhere on your local computer drive. We recommend making a new centralized folder to store all your Data 8X lab files.

    ### Step 2. Once you have downloaded the week's lab, open Anaconda Navigator, launch the vscode application (Microsoft Visual Studio Code).

    ### Step 3. In Microsoft Visual Studio Code, open the unzipped lab folder (lab01, lab02, etc).  You should see a "labxx.py" file.  This is the raw python lab file.  You can edit and complete the lab by going through the raw python lab file.

    ### Step 4. Complete the lab by reading and changing the "labxx.py" file.
